					<hr />

					<p>
						Join us for our summer meetup, hosted by Nexer Digital! In anticipation of Macc Pride the following weekend, this month's event will also be a celebration of pride.
					</p>

					<p>
						Enjoy an evening of inspiring talks, opportunities to meet and mingle, idea-sharing, and complimentary refreshments.
					</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<h2>Presentations:</h2>

					<p>
						<strong>Tech outside the Binary</strong> - Tracey Kerr (They / Them)
					</p>

					<p>
						Being an Ally isn't hard in any industry, sometimes it's as easy as not saying "ladies and gentlemen" or a singular gendered greeting like "guys" or "ladies" to groups of people you assume to be cisgendered. In this talk you're going to find out what it's like for trans and non-binary folks to navigate this cis-heteronormative world in tech, and how we can improve their experiences!
					</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>
						<strong>Talking Pride with AI</strong> - Mike Irving (He / Him)
					</p>

					<p>
						A technical demonstration of how to easily create a Conversational AI Chat App, using OpenAI and Microsoft Semantic Kernel. Once up and running we'll discuss the drawbacks of the AI model data, and see how we can add to that using Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), performing prompt engineering with some Macc Pride and other data!
					</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>
						<strong>Macc Pride overview</strong> - Macc Pride
					</p>

					<p>
						Some of the Macc Pride committee members will be attending, and will give us an overview of this year's Macc Pride on the 6th July.
					</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>
						Our hosts Nexer Digital will be providing complimentary refreshments and catering.
					</p>

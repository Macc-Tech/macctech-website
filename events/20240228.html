						We're back for our first Macc Tech of 2024, once again hosted at Nexer Digital.
					</p>

					<p>
						Join us for a series of talks and a chance to meet, mingle and share ideas, with refreshments provided.
					</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<h2>Presentations:</h2>

					<p>
						<strong>The Post Office Horizon Scandal: Service Failure</strong> - Amy Thornley
					</p>

					<p>
						A look at the the Post Office Horizon Scandal that has been dominating the headlines as of late from a Service Design perspective. Looking at the key layers of the service and organisations that may have shaped Horizon's failure. From culture, through to processes and technology - and what we can learn as people working on services using technology.
					</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>
						<strong>Why AI Development must prioritise Sustainability</strong> - Harry Stanyer
					</p>

					<p>
						As AI is more widely adopted globally, what are we learning about its impact on the planet? And what can developers do to make their AI more sustainable?
					</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>
						<strong>Rubbish Fun</strong> - Tom Chiverton
					</p>

					<p>
						Have you been to the Macc council waste collection web site? It's rubbish; Could we recycle it in to something better? I can't bring back your green bins, but I can show how I (very unofficially) wheeled out something easier. Expect to hear about decoding strange APIs, writing and deploying NodeJS code and where to host hobby projects.
					</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>
						Our hosts Nexer Digital will be providing complimentary refreshments and catering.
